          Once we have at least received proof of ownership, the surveyor's diagram, job letter, name of your lending institution and have conducted a site visit, you will receive a letter showing the estimated construction cost. This letter is to be shared with your loans officer. After you have been approved in writing for a loan National Housing will then provide you with the following:

        <ul class="p-1">
          <li>
            <p>

          <strong>The drawings as well as the APUA forms are to be submitted by you the client to DCA for review and approval. </strong> 
          Before taking the submission package to DCA, a submission fee of $35 must be paid to the Treasury. Upon approval a fee amounts to 50 cents per square foot must also be paid to the government treasury.

        </h6>

        <h6>
          Once DCA has approved your submission they will return to you two (2) approved copies of your drawings as well as stamped copies of the APUA forms. You the client are to submit the APUA forms to APUA to begin the process of installing water and electricity on the site.         </h6>

        <h6>
          After the bank and DCA have provided approval, you will alert National Housing. We will then begin the process of preparing your construction agreement as well as outlining the process to commencing construction on your land.
