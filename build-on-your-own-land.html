        <h3>Client Checklist - Build On Own Land-Using Proto Designs</h3>
        <h6>
          Any individual who desires to have the National Housing Development
          &amp; Urban Renewal Company construct one of our standard homes on
          their own land will need to provide the following:
        </h6>

        <ul class="p-1">
          <li><p>Job Letter</p></li>
          <li><p>Request to build letter stating the size of house you
            would like to construct</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Proof of ownership (copy of land register)</p>          
          </li>          
          <li><p>
            Name of lending institution
           </p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Authenticated Surveyor's diagram (Can be found at the Survey Department) 
            </p>          
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cadastral map (Can be found at the Survey Department)</p>
          </li>


        </ul>

        <h6>
          Once we have at least received proof of ownership, the surveyor's diagram, job letter, name of your lending institution and have conducted a site visit, you will receive a letter showing the estimated construction cost. This letter is to be shared with your loans officer. After you have been approved in writing for a loan National Housing will then provide you with the following:
        </h6>

        <ul class="p-1">
          <li>
            <p>
              Three (3) sets of drawings (There is a $250.00 printing and processing fee)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Completed building permit application forms APUA water forms (Client to fill in personal information) 
            </p>
          <li>

               APUA electrical forms (Client to fill in personal information) 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>
          The drawings as well as the APUA forms are to be submitted by you the client to DCA for review and approval. Before taking the submission package to DCA, a submission fee of $35 must be paid to the Treasury. 
        </h6>

        <h6>
          Once DCA has approved your submission they will return to you two (2) approved copies of your drawings as well as stamped copies of the APUA forms. You the client are to submit the APUA forms to APUA to begin the process of installing water and electricity on the site.         </h6>

        <h6>
          After the bank and DCA have provided approval, you will alert National Housing. We will then begin the process of preparing your construction agreement as well as outlining the process to commencing construction on your land.
